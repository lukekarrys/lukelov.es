There's so much good coffee and food that I never get to in downtown Phoenix. There's even a nice 20 mile route through a pretty easy series of bike routes and canals to get there. So coffeeneuring was a great excuse to get out and try some new places. I figured I would probably only get downtown once so I wanted to hit a few places even though it would only count towards one coffeeneuring challenge trip.

## The Ride

The Grand Canal connects my normal route from Mesa to Tempe with

My kids love animals, so when I saw some interesting looking birds I thought it would be fun to take pictures and try to identify them when I got home. We looked them up and [a super cool](http://www.birderfrommaricopa.com) website about birds in Maricopa County.

## The Drink(s)

I stopped at Xanadu Coffee first and I heard they make good espresso, so I kept it simple with a plain espresso.
