> Let us answer Galt’s questions, because he seems confused by some quite simple principles and seems to think those who disagree with him believe something different than what we actually believe. First, it is perfectly fine to take care of and serve yourself. Everyone should value themselves. What is not fine is caring only about yourself, because you are not the only one whose life should matter. (Plus, even from a “self-interested” perspective, we are all better off when we care about each other; in the “prisoners dilemma,” those who follow the Randian philosophy end up screwing each other over, while those with an ethic of solidarity end up with better outcomes for all. But this is a side point, because you should help others irrespective of the benefit to yourself.) Now, to answer Galt’s next question, it is not immoral to experience enjoyment. It is immoral to hoard enjoyment, to take more than you yourself need when there are others who have none at all. It is not “immoral to produce something of value and keep it for yourself.” It is immoral, once you have plenty, to keep accruing more. It being virtuous to give a gift to someone who needs it does not mean that it is “selfish” to accept a gift if you are the needy party. Again, selfishness is not when you do anything for yourself, it is when you are excessively concerned with yourself.
