i was reminded today (by my brain?) that i discovered the band The Handsome Family from an itunes playlist created by jim halpert that included “drunk by noon” with a quip about how he always thinks about that song around 11:59am each day.

here’s the only proof i could find that i didn’t dream that entire thing: https://pseudospork.livejournal.com/100746.html
