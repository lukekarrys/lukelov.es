I had been meaning to get out on this ride all week since first I heard about [coffeeneuring](https://chasingmailboxes.com/category/coffeeneuring/) on [r/surlybikefans](https://reddit.com/r/surlybikefans). Coffee! Bikes! Rules! What's not to love?

But it was tough to get out on this first ride. I knew that I had to start before Monday to finish all 7 rides by the deadline (again, I love rules!). So I found time on a weekend morning for my favorite coffeeshop that was also the closest and easiest ride, Pair Cupworks.

## The Ride

This is a ride I've made a bunch of times. It's my normal spot to go pickup coffee beans, as well as the place I go for a very good cup of coffee. I had to swing by the library first to dropoff a book that I've had since The Before Times. They emailed me to say they got rid of late fees (!!!) which reminded me that I had a book due since July. Oops!

I tried to stick to the specific [Mesa #3 route](http://www.azbikeped.org/downloads/mesa-bike-map.pdf) but veered off course a few times. Most side streets in the area are similarly wide without much traffic so it wasn't a big deal.

I also got to check out a local restaurant doing a Bob's Burgers themed popup where I scored a few stickers.

## The Drink

A Toasted Sesame Latte which is a new limited time menu item. It was delicious. Very toasty to makeup for the chilly 72 degrees (it felt like 68).

## One Good Thing

I didn't bring my phone! That feels like a silly thing to proclaim as my One Good Thing, but lately I've been feeling quite pulled to my phone during most of my downtime. So I left my phone at home and brought my Kindle, iPod Nano, and camera instead. It was a nice change of pace. I listened to some music on the ride and read a little bit on the patio and used the camera to take all these shots.
