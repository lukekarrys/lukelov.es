Down to the last day of the challenge, I just needed to ride my bike somewhere to get coffee that I hadn't already been to. I also needed a new stem for my bike. Good thing Cartel Coffee is right by my favorite bike shop The Bicycle Cellar in Tempe!

## The Ride

I took University all the way down to grab coffee and make my Bicycle Cellar appointment on time. They are an awesome shop that does super safe socially distant appointments. I texted them that I needed a shorter stem and they texted me back right away that they had one in stock and I could make an appointment to stop by.

On the way back I went through Papago and hit some climbs that I had to hike-a-bike to get up! I also came across a part of Papago I didn't know existed which some small dirt jumps. There's no way I was touching any of those so I did some downhill hike-a-bike also and walked my bike down and rode over to the nice flat canal.

## The Drink

An 80 degree day in November meant it was still iced coffee weather. I went with a small Iced Americano (since it was already the afternoon and I didn't want _that_ much caffeine) and chugged it. It was just too good to savor it.

## One Good Thing

New bike stem! I'm getting more comfortable with how this bike feels, and I could tell I was reaching a little far with the Moloko Bars. So I went down from a 90mm to 60mm stem and it feels much better. And props to the Bicycle Cellar for confirming that the fit looked better with the new stem.
