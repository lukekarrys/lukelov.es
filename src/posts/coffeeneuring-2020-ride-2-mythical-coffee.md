Some facts about me:

- I love good coffee at good coffee shops
- I love caffeine
- I try to only drink caffeine in the mornings
- I am not a morning person (hence the love of caffeine)

These combine to make coffeeneuring a morning only activity for me, but I always fight the inertia of the morning to get out the door. I could go in the afternoons, but I would be sad to go to an amazing coffee shop and not get my caffeine via an amazing coffee drink.

But I did it! I got up early(-er) than usual so I could get out for a longer ride to a shop I really like: Mythical Coffee.

## The Ride

It was almost chilly when I went outside. I backtracked a bit for the quietest route to the Consolidated Canal which is also a section of the Maricopa Trail. I mostly stayed on the unpaved side as I made my way south, passing by some interesting houses with horses, cows, and I think I spotted a peacock.

After the coffee, I went back on surface streets and was able to stick mostly to bike lanes. I made a few wrong turns trying to guess how far south Horne went but I got it eventually. I also passed by a large grass drainage area that I did a quick lap around. I'm currently rocking 700x38 tires on the Cross-Check which make potholes, unpaved canals, and grass like this a ton of fun.

Also the route to me looked like a really unfortunately balanced bear, but my daughter thought it was more of a ladybug.

## The Drink(s)

I got to Mythical and was craving a plain cup o' coffee. They roast really great beans and turn that into a really great pour over.

I drank it outside and the weather was perfect by that point. It was so nice and I wasn't ready to leave yet (and needed a bit more caffeine) so I got a macchiato. I also got sucked in by the pastry case and saw they had gluten free pastries and opted for an apple cider donut. They made a delicious pair and there's nothing I love more than dipping a donut in coffee.

## One Good Thing

I brought my journal which has seen on and off use this year but mostly off lately. It was nice to write up some random thoughts on something other than a screen. It always relaxes me.
