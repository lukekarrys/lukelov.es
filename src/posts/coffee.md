I definitely wanted to bring the kids on one of my coffeeneuring rides. Saturday proved to be a good day as the weather was nice (although windy) and our morning was wide open (like pretty much every morning). The kids were enticed with a choice between hot chocolate and lemonade, and lemonade was the resounding favorite. I guess that's Phoenix in November for ya. While not technically a coffee drink, the fact that I tried to push the hot cocoa means I think it's within the rules and they've gone on their first official coffeeneuring ride.

## The Ride

Pulling the 5 year old and 2 year old in the Burley means I try to avoid any major intersections. I was able to mostly do that by using the bike routes through our neighborhood and then a short distance on the sidewalk to cross one major road. It's not the best route but provides the closest Starbucks/park combo, and the company more than made up for it.

## The Drink(s)

Starbucks lemonade (or any lemonade) is a favorite of my kids. In fact, Starbucks is basically a lemonade shop to them. I don't love Starbucks but it has a few drinks that I like. Seeing how it was not a cool day, I opted for the cold brew which is decent but it has their cold foam which is delicious.

## One Good Thing

Playing soccer with my kids which turned into a game of "Steal the Ball from the Sleeping Tiger". There are rules that the 5 year old came up with but they changed a lot and I'll not sure I could explain them.
