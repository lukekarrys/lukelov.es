I definitely wanted to bring the kids on one of my coffeeneuring rides. One day we'll all be out on our own bikes, but for now the easiest way is to use the bike trailer. Saturday proved to be a good day as the weather was nice (although windy) and our morning was wide open (like pretty much every morning). The kids were enticed with a choice between hot chocolate and lemonade, and lemonade was the resounding favorite. I guess that's Phoenix in November for ya. I think lemonade counts as a kid coffee style beverage, so they can now say they've gone on their first official coffeeneuring ride.

## The Ride

Pulling the 5 year old and 2 year old in the Burley means I try to avoid any major intersections. For all the bike friendliness of the neighborhoods around us, there's some directions that are still difficult to go. The canals and numbered bike routes are very nice, but in this case even the numbered bike route going this direction crosses a 5 lane road with no signal at all.

But I was able to mostly stay on quiet streets with wide bike lanes, but I still had to opt for a short distance on the sidewalk to cross one major road. It's not the best route but provides the closest Starbucks/park combo, and the company more than made up for it.

## The Drink(s)

Starbucks lemonade (or any lemonade) is a favorite of my kids. In fact, Starbucks is basically a lemonade shop to them. I always prefer a small coffeeshop but use Starbucks as a break-glass-in-case-of-needing-coffee-shop. It has a few drinks that I like. Seeing how it was warm day, I opted for the cold brew (which is decent) with the cold foam (which is delicious).

## One Good Thing

Playing soccer with my kids which turned into a game of "Steal the Ball from the Sleeping Tiger". There are rules that the 5 year old came up with, but they changed a few times and I'll not sure I could explain them in any case.
