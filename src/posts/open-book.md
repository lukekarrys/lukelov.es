So this José González video is him with a deformed human sized worm with a face. If that doesn't scare you off, you might end up watching it on repeat like I did, hypnotized by the beauty that slowly comes into focus through the melding of finger picked guitar, haunting images, and lyrics on overcoming loss.

  "A drifting vessel in the storm
  <br />
  Pushed around from shore to shore
  <br />
  I know there's so much left to see
  <br />I know I have so much left to give"
