So this José González video is him with a deformed human sized worm with a face. If that doesn't scare you off, you might end up watching it on repeat like I did, hypnotized by the beauty that slowly comes into focus through the melding of finger picked guitar, haunting images, and lyrics on overcoming loss.

Pushed around from shore to shore<br/>
I know there's so much left to see<br/>
I know I have so much left to give"</a>
