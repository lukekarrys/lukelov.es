Day 1

Roads following US BR 90
Crossed some flat trails to get to Broadway
Broadway trailhead to Jacob Crosscut
Pushed up most of the first section, once I got to the flat part it was still touch and go with hike-a-bike
Rolled up to the campground after sundown. Made my way to the ranger station to check in.
Back to my campsite to cook, make camp, and then just chill in the tent. Tuna Casserole and finished the gummy bears.
Super warm even as it got down to 36. I was sheltered from the wind a little by a large bush and left my tent door open for awhile and my rain fly door open all night

Day 2
Woke up. found some nice neighbors to charge my phone while I did a lap around the park.
Made my way to the ranger station for some extra reserve snacks and found some cool nature guides for the kids
Made my way out of the park and crossed the road to the Goldfields. I ran into a few mountain bikes who I asked how the goldfields were. They laughed a bit and said it was a mixed bag and hopefully my route didn't have too much hike-a-bike. Looking back I think they were being very kind at my inexperience as my route was full of hike-a-bike.
The beginning was very phone and flowy before getting a little offshoot from the forest road. Super narrow and going up, I hiked most of it.
Finally got the forest road again which was very nice before it got rough in Bulldog Canyon.
I dropped the bike a few times going slow and getting stuck.
One time I looked at the back and saw the railwing for my Coconino was hanging off the back of the bike. It was missing a bolt but luckily I brought a few zipties and got it back on the bike.
The rest of bulldog canyon was rough. Brake riding down hills and pushing up other hills. My legs were getting tired.
I made it to the Bush highway finally and had originall though about a detour through Hawes but decided instead on just the 18 miles straight shot home via the highway and canal.
The road and canal were quick with a quick stop at the river to check out the sunset on Red Mountain.

For next time:

- More snacks. I love snacks
- Make a list with everything broken down. Coffee != coffee, aeropress, filters, etc
- Lid for the pot to make boiling water faster
- Thicker camp pants
- Long wool underwear
- Battery mishap

Long term:

- I'd love to cut down on my sleeping bag size with a warmer pad + quilt setup
- Suspenion fork
